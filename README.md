# Ecommerce-Data-Quality
A data cleaning project focused on enhancing the quality of an unclean e-commerce dataset. Includes steps like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and data transformation, with checkpoints to restore the dataset at various stages.
## Dataset Description

The dataset contains a list of products sold by an online store. Each row corresponds to a product and includes details about the product (e.g., color, size, price) as well as information about the seller (e.g., rating, photos, country).

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
- Provide checkpoints at crucial stages, allowing for the recovery of the dataset in case of irreversible changes during the cleaning process.
- Demonstrate various data quality improvement techniques.
